<h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to enhance predictive capabilities for early-onset diabetes by developing advanced prediction models such as machine learning and deep learning techniques. The research seeks to support early disease detection and track the potential progression of complications like Diabetic Retinopathy. By addressing critical gaps in current diabetes detection and management strategies, the study aims to transform clinical decision-making processes. These innovative approaches have the potential to significantly improve patient care, offering more targeted prevention strategies and ultimately reducing the long-term economic burden of diabetes management.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The following implementations are used for predictive measures:

5 different machine learning/DL approaches used for classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Neural Network

1 deep learning approach used for classifying model severity based on images:
  - Convoluted Neural Network (CNN)

<h2>Findings</h2>
Our findings indicate most important factors influencing both the type of diabetes and the severity of diabetic retinopathy in patients that potentially lead to blindness. Additionally, observations of images on severity predict about 72% in accuracy by identifying the level of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic/pre-diabetic patients.
